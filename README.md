# Press Runner

This is the README for your extension "Press Runner". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Usages

Bind your preferred shortcut to the extension command using either method below:

### Option 1: For Vim Keybindings

If you use the [VSCodeVim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim), add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
        {
            "before": ["<leader>", "r"],  // Customize your preferred key combo
            "commands": ["press-runner.run"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Option 2: Standard VSCode Keybinding

Alternatively, add this to your `keybindings.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "ctrl+r",  // Customize your preferred shortcut
        "command": "press-runner.run",
        "when": "editorTextFocus"
    }
]
```

> **Tips**:  
>
> - Replace the key combinations with your preferred shortcuts
> - Use VSCode's command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to quickly open these files:
>   - "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
>   - "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"

## Extension Configuration

### Option 1: With Settings UI (Recommended)

Configure directly through settings UI (Ctrl+, or âŒ˜+,) by searching for "Press Runner" commands.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually edit your `settings.json` with language-specific commands. Example configurations are provided for Python and C++.

```json
{
    // Global setting: Controls whether all commands should run in the terminal by default
    "press-runner.globalUseTerminal": "auto",

    // Python commands map configuration
    "press-runner.commandsMap.python.Commands": {
        "plugin": "ms-python.python",
        "command": "python.execInTerminal",
        "terminal": "python -u ${fileName}"
    },
    // Controls whether Python command uses terminal
    "press-runner.commandsMap.python.useTerminal": "global", 
    
    // C++ command configuration
    "press-runner.commandsMap.cpp.Commands": {
        "plugin": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
        "command": "cmake.launchTarget",
        "terminal": "cd ${dir} && g++ ${fileName} -o ${fileNameWithoutExt} && ${dir}${fileNameWithoutExt}"
    },
    // Controls whether C++ command uses terminal
    "press-runner.commandsMap.cpp.useTerminal": "global",
}
```
